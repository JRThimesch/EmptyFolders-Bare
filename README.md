# EmptyFolders-Bare
Small little script I made to save myself a headache. Pulls all files from subdirectories and outputs into the directory the script is in.

## HOW TO USE:
  Put this script into the folder containing the subdirectories you would like to pull files from. Run the script inside the directory and all files should now be within the root directory of the script.
